## Introduction

### What is a database ?
A database is a way to store data in a format which makes it easily accessible.

Consider storing data of each person in different files. There would be tons of files, accessing files based on a condition like, accessing files where persons age > 18 or any other is complex and we have to write program for that.

But in databases the particular data can be obtained easily. The data retrieval in databases is done by writing ***Queries***.

***Query*** - The query is like a question you ask the database. Like asking the database to give me a the persons data with age > 18, or if the person lives in particular place. A query is done my a **command** that follows a syntax.

### SQL

Structured Query Language (SQL) is the standard language used to interact with databases. It's all about writing queries that fetch the correct result. It allows users to store, retrieve, update and manage data efficiently through simple commands.  

### CRUD operations

CRUD stands for create, read, update and delete. These are the primary operations that are performed on any database.

### What is a Database Management System (DBMS)? 

A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that interacts with end users,
applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. It allows for the creation, retrieval, updating, and management of data in databases.
 
If you know one DBMS, you can easily transition to another, as they share similar concepts andfunctionalities.

Ex: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL ... etc

### Relational DBMS and Non-relational DBMS

#### Relational DBMS

- Follows a fixed and predefined schema
- Data is organised into structured tables in rows and columns
- Ensures data integrity through constraints and relationships
- Utilizes SQL for defining and manipulating data
- Well-suited for applications requiring complex queries and transactional consistency.
